## Features

#### Desktop environment:
- It is composed of a wallpaper along with a taskbar
- The taskbar contains a clock, volume and internet icons.
- A start menu.
- Draggabble window (Bugged)

#### Programs:
- Terminal - you can write and execute commands
- File manager - for now it is a static image, functions will be added later.
- Browser - You can browse the internet (currently it only uses html 3, so most of the pages don't work very well)

#### Miscellaneous:
- Boot loader.
- BIOS.
- RSOD (Red Screen of Death)
- BSOD (Black Screen of Death)
- GSOD (Green Screen of death)
- Login.
- Desktop mode.
- Terminal mode.
- File system.

## Some current ideas...
- Antivirus (fake)
- Control panel
- Draggable desktop icons
- Internet
- System configuration

## Installation

First of all, it is necessary to have Python 3.10 for the right functioning (although with previous versions it works fine)

Pillow and tkinterweb modules must be installed

Download the code, unzip it and double click on OS.py file to run the project
