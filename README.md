## Features

#### Desktop environment:
- It is composed of a wallpaper along with a taskbar
- The taskbar contains a clock, volume and internet icons.
- A start menu.
- Draggabble window (Bugged)

#### Programs:
- Terminal - you can write and execute commands
- File manager - for now it is a static image, functions will be added later.
- Browser - You can browse the internet (currently it only uses html 3, so most of the pages don't work very well)

#### Miscellaneous:
- Boot loader.
- BIOS.
- RSOD (Red Screen Of Death).
- Login.
- Desktop mode.
- Terminal mode.
- File system.

## Current ideas
- Antivirus (fake)
- Control panel
- Draggable desktop icons
- Internet
- System configuration

## Installation

First of all, it is necessary to have Python 9.10 for the right functioning (although with previous versions it works fine)

The following modules must be installed:
```bash
  Module     Version
  ---------- -------
  Pillow     9.0.0
  tkinterweb 3.10.7 
```

Download the code, unzip it and double click on OS.py file to run the project
