#### Beginner's Handbook

This manual explains the keyboard shortcuts to navigate on the new Window Manager (the mouse is still necessary XD)
**NOTICE**: For now, this applies only to Terminal, windows of other programs can still be dragged normally

**Terminal keyboard shortcuts:**

- The Terminal can be placed on the Right by pressing:
<alt> + <right-arrow>

- Or can be placed on the Left by pressing:
<alt> + <left-arrow>

**NOTE:** (for this to work, the window must be focused or active)

- To focus a window, <double-click> on it

- To bring the window to the front of the others, press <right-click> on it

- To close it just press <alt> + <q>
