# Beginner's Handbook

> **NOTE**: For now, this applies only to Terminal, windows of other programs can still be dragged normally
- This manual explains the keyboard shortcuts to navigate on the new Window Manager (the mouse is still necessary XD).
- For keyboard shortcuts to have an effect on a window, that window must be active or focused

### Terminal keyboard shortcuts:
- Can be placed on the Right by pressing:
`<alt> + <right-arrow>`
- Also can be placed on the Left by pressing:
`<alt> + <left-arrow>`
- To focus a Terminal window, `<double-click>` on it
- To bring the Terminal window to the front of the others, press `<right-click>` on it
- To close it just press `<alt> + <q>`, or type the `exit` command
